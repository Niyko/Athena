Athena is a tool used to move change data capture from Microsoft SQL to Apache Kafka. Athena is written in Golang. Athena supports SASL authentication-based Kafka broker servers. Other tools like Debezium are available, but are a pain in the head to set up and manage them with MSSQL. Debezium gives you very little room for configuration while using it as a connector from services like confluent.io. Athena is very simple to set up and can be managed easily without any unwanted complications.
